My name is Muhammad Ahmed Raza and I am 18 years old. I am currently a student at FAST University studying Software Engineering. I am interested and want to persue a career in web, game or software development and if not possible then anything related to computers. I know basic python as we have studied it in A-levels and am now learning C language in my university.
